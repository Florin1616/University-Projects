a. Determine the successor of a number represented as digits in a list. <br />
Eg.: [1 9 3 5 9 9] --> [1 9 3 6 0 0]<br />
b. For a heterogeneous list, formed from integer numbers and list of numbers, determine the successor of a <br />
sublist considered as a number.<br />
[1, [2, 3], 4, 5, [6, 7, 9], 10, 11, [1, 2, 0], 6] => <br />
[1, [2, 4], 4, 5, [6, 8, 0], 10, 11, [1, 2, 1], 6]
