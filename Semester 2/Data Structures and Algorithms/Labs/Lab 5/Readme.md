# Lab 5: Binary Search Tree

Implement in C++ the given container (ADT) using a given representation and a binary search tree (BST) as a data structure. You are not allowed to use any container or data structure from STL or <br/>
from any other library.<br/>
Do not implement a separate class for the binary search tree (or for the dynamic array), implement the container directly!
