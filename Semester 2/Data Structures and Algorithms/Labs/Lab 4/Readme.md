# Lab 4: Hashtable

Implement in C++ the given container (ADT) using a given representation and a hashtable with a <br/>
given collision resolution (separate chaining, coalesced chaining, open addressing) as a data structure. <br/>
You are not allowed to use any container or data structure from STL or from any other library.<br/>
Do not implement a separate class for the hashtable (or dynamic array, or anything), implement <br/>
the container directly!<br/>
The hashtable has to be dynamic: no matter what collision resolution has to be used, set a <br/>
threshold for α and resize and rehash the table when the actual load factor is higher than α.<br/>

## 28. ADT MultiMap – using a hashtable with separate chaining in which (key, value) pairs are stored. If a key has multiple values, it appears in multiple pairs.
