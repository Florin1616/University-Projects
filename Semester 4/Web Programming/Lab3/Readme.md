# Project Description

This project involves developing an HTML+CSS web document that resembles the [BBC homepage](http://www.bbc.com/). 

## Requirements

- Clone about one screen of the BBC homepage. Your HTML document should look approximately 90% like the given web page.
- No interactivity should be added. This means no JavaScript or `:hover` effects.
- You are not allowed to use any CSS or JavaScript libraries.

The goal is to practice your HTML and CSS skills by replicating an existing web page as closely as possible.
