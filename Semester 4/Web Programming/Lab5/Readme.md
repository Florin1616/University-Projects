# Project Description

This project involves creating an HTML page that contains a puzzle game. The game is based on a table with four rows and four columns, filled with distinct random numbers from 1 to 15 (one of the cells being empty).

## Requirements

- Write an HTML page that contains a table with four rows and four columns.
- The table's cells should contain distinct random numbers from 1 to 15, with one of the cells being empty.
- Using JavaScript, create a puzzle game that the user must solve.

## Version 2

Create a second version of the game, where numbers are replaced by small images, initially part of a bigger image. 

- For slicing the original image into smaller pieces, you may use picture editing software such as Photoshop or Gimp.

The goal is to practice your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by creating an interactive puzzle game.
