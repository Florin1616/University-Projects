# Project Description

This project involves creating two different web pages with specific requirements.

## Web Page 1

Create a web page with a squared box built using 4 lines (which are divs). Each line/div should be fully transparent in the middle and opaque at the edges.

## Web Page 2

Create a webpage which contains a horizontal line (an "hr" or "div" or something else) on top of the page. The color of the line is blue. The line starts descending on the bottom of the page (when the mouse is over it) and while descending, the part of the web page above the line will start to be colored with a blue vertical gradient color. When the line reaches the bottom of the page, all the web page is colored with a vertical blue gradient.
